- The Arduino should be mounted on pin headers, not soldered directly to the board
- In general, mount and solder the components on the back of the board first
- The one exception is the pin headers, which should be soldered last, as they hinder access to pads for pots
- We also must take care to solder the power connector before soldering the CLK OUT jack
- This is because one pad (S - sleeve) of the CLK OUT cuts into the courtyard of the power connector
- In addition, the CLK OUT S (sleeve) might have to be soldered from front of board (only)
